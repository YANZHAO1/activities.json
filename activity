For each map specify the length of the word by the blank underline present at the top of the map. If you wanted to make it harder (for older grades) you can leave no blanks on the maps so that the students are required to figure out the anagram through both knowing the theme of the hunt, and the amount of pictures they had to find.2. Figure out what and how many letters are required for each map as this will also determine how many pictures you will need. The example in the additional resources has at least 15 pictures and 15 words, themed around Easter.3. In the mapKeys document, make sure that you specify which letters correspond with which picture location. The pictures are numbered to make this proccess easier. For example, the word \"Easter\" has the picture code of (14, 11, 3, 9, 14, 1)3. Print out and laminate both the maps (which are numbered) and the letters. Then print out the map legend(which will be used by students to figure out the anagram, the file for this in the example is \"Map1\").4. Using the MapKeys for the pictures (see additional resources), tape the printed out letters at the locations corresponding to the numbers for the pictures. Make sure you hide them in a way that's not too difficult, but not too easy also. This turns into a sort of anagram hunt, as children search for the letter with the corresponding picture.Note that the Additional resources are examples for you to create your own version of the picture hunt.

Dispose of any excess bits of slime in the trash—do not pour them down the drain, or they could cause a clog.What Happened?Glue is very runny. When you mix contact solution with glue, a chemical reaction occurs that causes the glue to get thicker. This reaction takes some time, which is why you have to stir and knead the slime.
